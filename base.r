### Load libraries
  library(dplyr)

### Load methods
  tmpWD <- getwd() # retrieve working directory
  setwd(paste(tmpWD,"methods/",sep="/")) # change to methods directory
  l <- lapply(list.files(), source) # source methods
  setwd(tmpWD) # go back to working directory

### Set queue (I use this variable when running simulations on computer clusters with independent execution of jobs)
  queue <- 1

### Setting parameters for simulations
  variances <- 100            # payoff variance (1 = low, 100 = high)
  mean <- 4                   # mean payoff in the world
  k_seq <- (mean^2)/variances # calcualte k parameter of the gamma distribution used in the simualtion to draw random patch payoff values based on the chosen mean and variance
  e_seq <- 10^-1.5            # environmental turnover rate (probability that a patch changes its payoff in a given round)

# create all possible combinations of parameters
  grid <- expand.grid(k=k_seq, # k parameter of gamma distribution
                      e=e_seq, # environmental turnover
                      xm=c(0.01,0.02,0.04,0.08,seq(from=0.1,to=1,by=.1)), # proportion of reproductive males
                      xf=c(0.01,0.02,0.04,0.08,seq(from=0.1,to=1,by=.1)), # proportion of reproductive females

                      p=c(.5,2), # proportion of social learning (0,...,1=none, ..., all social learner; 2=mixed learning)
                      h=c(T,F), # whether reproduction is relative or absolute to collected payoffs
                      r=c(.20), # temporal discount rate
                      c=c(1), # competition coefficient (0,...,1=no competition, ..., full scramble competition)
                      rep=1:5) # repetition of each parameter set
  
  #grid <- grid[grid[,"xf"]>grid[,"xm"],] # use this option to only simulate combinations where "males" have stronger reproductive skew than females (i.e. smaller proportion of males reproducing than in females)

# Loop over all parameter combinations
  # for(queue in 456:910){ 
    # select individual parameters for the current queue number
